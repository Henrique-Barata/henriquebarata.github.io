            <h3>Project Title 2</h3>
            <p>I have been a Software Engineer at VA|PREVENTION for 15 months, where I was awarded a scholarship from FCT (Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia). I conceived and developed a comprehensive web application with a scientific foundation aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes through the use of a virtual assistant. Additionally, I configured the online web server and database, managing environment settings to ensure secure and efficient application interactions.
                In this project, I worked with a team of 16 researchers from five higher education institutions, gaining experience in a dynamic, team-based setting. This helped me improve my skills in coordination, communication, and adapting to changing project requirements, while contributing to the successful completion of key research goals.</p>
