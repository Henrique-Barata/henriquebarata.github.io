                <h3>VA|PREVENTION Web Application</h3>
                <p>I have been a Software Engineer at VA|PREVENTION for 15 months. In this project, I worked with a team of 16 researchers from five higher education institutions, gaining experience in a dynamic, team-based setting. This helped me improve my skills in coordination, communication, and adapting to changing project requirements, while contributing to the successful completion of key research goals.</p>

                <h3>Dream Team Web site</h3>
                <p>I created a simple one-page website for Dream Team, a company offering private driver rental services. The page provides a streamlined overview of Dream Team’s services, highlighting the company’s commitment to exceptional and personalized transportation experiences. It ensures that users on smartphones, tablets, and desktops can easily navigate and read about the company’s offerings.</p>

                <h3>Project Title 1</h3>
                <p>I gained expertise in parallel and concurrent programming, developing skills to write and interpret complex programs for multicore, GPU, and distributed environments. My experience spans various programming models and techniques, including embarrassingly parallel tasks, parallel divide-and-conquer, and GPU programming for intensive computations.

                    I worked with synchronization primitives, dynamic load balancing through work-stealing, and granularity control for managing irregular parallelism. They also covered distributed memory programming, message-passing with the Actor model, and large-scale data processing with Map-Reduce. Additionally, I focused on debugging and verifying concurrent programs, ensuring efficiency and correctness in environments where tasks execute simultaneously or interleave..</p>

                <h3>Thymio robot project for visually impaired </h3>
                <p>The objective of this work was to explore Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) by creating a Maze Navigation Game using a Thymio robot for visually impaired users. For the project it was develop an accessible smartphone app with auditory and vibrotactile feedback, enabling navigation through voice commands, buttons, and gyroscope controls.</p>

                <h3>Robot programing for a maze navigation using odometry and motion sensors </h3>
                <p>The Thymio robot was programmed to use infrared commands and autonomously navigate through the maze. It utilizes odometry and sensors to navigate independently, reaching various checkpoints and adjusting its path based on obstacles, providing accurate and efficient navigation throughout the maze.</p>

                <h3>Roman Theatre - Blender Project</h3>
                <p>The objective of this project is the virtual recreation of a historical monument—the Roman Theater of Lisbon—as well as a one-minute animated tour of it.
                    <br>The project was completed in Blender, with the theater's structure/foundation modeled manually and enhanced with some models imported from StackBlitz and Mixamo to create a more immersive and realistic environment.</p>
