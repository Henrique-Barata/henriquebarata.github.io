        <h1>Roman Theatre of Lisbon</h1>
        <p>Introduction</p>
        <p>The objective of this project was to virtually recreate a historical monument – the Roman Theatre of Lisbon – and to provide a one-minute virtual tour of the site through animation. The project was carried out using Blender, where the theatre and its foundation were manually modeled with some imported models from StackBlitz and Mixano to enhance the immersive and realistic environment. This report explains the various steps involved in the implementation of this project.</p>

        <h2>Modeling</h2>
        <p>To achieve a more realistic model and immersive environment, the theatre was modeled based on reference images and blueprints provided for the project (Figures on the cover of this report). We also decorated the model with figures imported that reflected the Roman era depicted in the design.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="project-section">
        <h2>Foundation</h2>
        <p>We started by aligning the lateral blueprint image with Blender's axes and defining the scale for the workspace. A plane was then created and subdivided, allowing easy modifications for the initial foundation where the Theatre would stand.</p>

        <h2>Roman Theatre: Division by Parts</h2>
        <p>The modeling process was divided into three main parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Lower Part (1): Comprising the stairs, courtyard, roof with columns and railing. This section also includes the Porticus Post Scaenam.</li>
            <li>The Upper Part (2): The main "coliseum" area, which would hold the audience, orchestra, stage, and its entrances.</li>
            <li>The Exterior (3): Consisting of the courtyard, access stairs to the Theatre, and the Decumanus (streets).</li>
        </ol>
