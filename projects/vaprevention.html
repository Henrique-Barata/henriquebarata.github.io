            I served as the project software engineer for 15 months, where I took on the responsibility of developing the entire application from the ground up. I conceived and developed a comprehensive web application with a scientific foundation aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes through the use of a virtual assistant. Additionally, I configured the online web server and database, managing environment settings to ensure secure and efficient application interactions.
In this project, I worked with a team of 16 researchers from five higher education institutions, gaining experience in a dynamic, team-based setting. This helped me improve my skills in coordination, communication, and adapting to changing project requirements, while contributing to the successful completion of key research goals.

        <p>
            
            My role involved not only writing clean, efficient code but also ensuring the application’s scalability, security, and performance, all while collaborating closely with the team to meet the project’s goals. My responsibilities included:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Software Developer</strong>: Designing and implementing both the front-end and back-end of the application using PHP, Laravel, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring seamless integration between server-side logic and dynamic user interfaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>: Developing the entire application, working across the full technology stack to deliver a cohesive, functional product.</li>
            <li><strong>System Architect</strong>: Structuring the application’s architecture following the MVC pattern, ensuring scalability and maintainability for future iterations.</li>
            <li><strong>Database Administrator</strong>: Designing and managing the relational database schema, focusing on data integrity, optimization, and scalability.</li>
            <li><strong>DevOps Engineer</strong>: Handling server configurations, deployment pipelines, and the overall hosting environment to ensure secure and scalable infrastructure.</li>
            <li><strong>UI/UX Designer</strong>: Crafting user-centered workflows and interactive designs, focusing on accessibility for older adults, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer</strong>: Conducting thorough usability testing and debugging to refine the application’s interface navigation and improve overall performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Security Specialist</strong>: Implementing robust security features such as data encryption, role-based access controls, and secure transmission protocols to protect user data.</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation Specialist</strong>: Creating comprehensive technical guides, instructional videos, and a scientific poster to support users and developers.</li>
            <li><strong>Support Engineer</strong>: Providing ongoing maintenance, troubleshooting, and user support, ensuring smooth operation and user satisfaction throughout the lifecycle of the application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            This project focused on the development, implementation, and evaluation of the web application for the VA|PREVENTION project, a digital intervention aimed at preventing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) through personalized support and behavior change strategies. With T2D being a growing global public health concern, the application offers a modern solution to the challenges of traditional prevention programs by providing accessible, consistent, and engaging support to at-risk individuals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application’s core innovation is the integration of a virtual assistant named <strong>Ema</strong>, which I developed to deliver motivational guidance and personalized support to users. Ema interacts dynamically with users in Portuguese, adapting dialogs based on their responses and health data, ensuring a highly tailored experience. The assistant operates across three distinct phases of the intervention: <strong>Assessment</strong>, <strong>Follow-Up</strong>, and <strong>Maintenance</strong>, providing step-by-step guidance tailored to users' progress and goals.
